# Debt in Focus: Understanding Its Impact on GDP Growth

### Project Overview

This project looks at the trends in public debt, focusing on domestic debt and external debt in relation to annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By studying these trends over the years, the analysis helps explain how debt impacts a countryâ€™s economy. The goal is to provide a basic understanding of the connection between debt and economic health.

### Data Sources

-publicdebt.csv

This dataset contains historical records of public debt, split into two key categories:

-Domestic Debt: Debt owed by the government to its citizens or institutions within the country.

-External Debt: Debt owed to foreign creditors.

The data includes annual figures, detailing the total debt amounts in both categories for a specific period.

-annualgdp.csv

This dataset provides the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for the same period as the public debt data.

It includes information about the overall economic output, measured in the country's currency, for each year, serving as a basis to calculate the debt-to-GDP ratio.

### Tools 

-Excel - Data cleaning

-Jupyter Notebook - Main analysis platform

-Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis

-Matplotlib - Data visualization

-Seaborn - Enhanced visualizations

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data Loading and Inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and Formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

How have domestic and external debt levels changed over the years?

How does the ratio of domestic debt to external debt change annually?

What is the breakdown of total debt into domestic and external components over time?

How have nominal and real GDP, as well as annual GDP growth rates, evolved over the years?

How do domestic and external debt levels compare to GDP over time?

How does the growth rate of debt compare to the growth rate of GDP?

### Key Findings
The close split between Domestic Debt (48.8%) and External Debt (51.2%) suggests that Kenya maintains a relatively balanced borrowing strategy. This balance may help the country mitigate risks, such as currency fluctuations or interest rate changes that could affect external debt more severely.

The increasing reliance on both domestic and external debt signals a potential vulnerability to economic shocks, especially if interest rates rise or if there are downturns in global markets. Balancing the two types of debt is crucial for long-term financial stability.

### Conclusion

This analysis of public debt trends over the last two decades shows how borrowing, economic growth, and financial responsibility are connected. It is important to look at key economic indicators and how borrowing has changed over time. The findings highlight the need for careful debt management, especially when it comes to both external and domestic loans, and investing in projects that will help the economy in the long run.
