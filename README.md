# Debt in Focus: Understanding Its Impact on GDP Growth

### Project Overview

This project looks at the trends in public debt, focusing on domestic debt and external debt in relation to annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP). By studying these trends over the years, the analysis helps explain how debt impacts a countryâ€™s economy. The goal is to provide a basic understanding of the connection between debt and economic health.

### Data Sources

-publicdebt.csv

This dataset contains historical records of public debt, split into two key categories:

-Domestic Debt: Debt owed by the government to its citizens or institutions within the country.

-External Debt: Debt owed to foreign creditors.

The data includes annual figures, detailing the total debt amounts in both categories for a specific period.

-annualgdp.csv

This dataset provides the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for the same period as the public debt data.

It includes information about the overall economic output, measured in the country's currency, for each year, serving as a basis to calculate the debt-to-GDP ratio.
